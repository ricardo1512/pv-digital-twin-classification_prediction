    """
        Preprocesses inverter CSV data for inference by extracting daily features.

        Steps performed:
        1. Reads all CSV files from the 'Inverters' folder.
        2. Converts 'collectTime' to datetime format.
        3. Extracts the inverter ID from the filename.
        4. Groups data by day and checks if the inverter had an inverter_state of 768 on that day.
        5. Optionally applies moving average smoothing to numeric features (excluding inverter_state and weather features).
        6. Extracts comprehensive features for each day using `extract_comprehensive_features`.
        7. Combines all daily features into a single DataFrame.
        8. Exports the processed DataFrame to the specified output path.

        Args:
            smoothing (bool, optional): Whether to apply moving average smoothing to numeric features. Defaults to False.
            all_year (bool, optional): If True, includes data from all months.
            winter (bool, optional): If True, filters the dataset for winter months only.
