    """
        Run inference on a real dataset using a pre-trained Random Forest classifier.

        This function performs the following steps:
            1. Loads a pre-trained Random Forest model from disk.
            2. Reads the inference dataset CSV containing features and metadata.
            3. Selects the features required by the model.
            4. Performs classification to predict condition labels for each sample.
            5. Saves the predictions to a CSV file, including 'ID', 'date', and 'predicted_condition'.
            6. Counts occurrences of each predicted condition type and exports a summary report CSV.
            7. Generates a bar plot of the distribution of predicted conditions.
            8. Computes class probabilities for each sample and saves them to a CSV.
            9. Generates individual bar plots for each sample, showing the probability of being in each class.
            10. Selects and scales probabilities for decision making.
            11. Generates a report of selected and scaled probability combinations and exports it to CSV.
            12. Generates bar plots for each sample showing selected and scaled probabilities for further analysis.

        Args:
            all_year (bool, optional): If True, includes data from all months.
            winter (bool, optional): If True, filters the dataset for winter months only.
            
        Inputs:
            - `inference_test_file`: CSV file with test data.
            - `MODELS_FOLDER`: Folder to pre-trained Random Forest model.
            - Other output paths: CSV, image, and plot directories.

        Outputs:
            - CSV file with predicted condition labels per sample.
            - CSV file with predicted probabilities per sample.
            - Summary report CSV with counts of each predicted class.
            - Distribution plot of predicted conditions.
            - Individual bar plots of predicted probabilities for each sample.
            - Selected and scaled probabilities CSV per sample.
            - Report CSV of selected and scaled probability combinations sorted by combination size and count.
            - Bar plots of selected and scaled probabilities for each sample.
